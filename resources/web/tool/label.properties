smallScaleNodeList.smallScaleNodeListSubTitle=Small Node List overview
smallScaleNodeList.smallScaleNodeListSubSentence=Blockchains like Symbol need more worker nodes on the network. And the operation of a node requires certain financial costs and management skills. On this page, we will show you carefully selected and stable nodes, but with a small number of delegates. <br /> Only stable nodes are listed, so please feel free to delegate and collaborate with these nodes.
smallScaleNodeList.targetTitle=Description
smallScaleNodeList.targetSentence=This page automatically shows nodes with the following parameters. <br /> <b> (1) Total node delegate imports: less than 500,000 XYM</b><br />A monthly (annual) financial fee is required for the VPS to operate the node. Shown here are the nodes that haven't reached the minimum payable reward.<br /><br /><b>(2) Node Uptime History: Only nodes that have been up for a specific period of time are listed.<br />※We regret not adding to this list the node operators that have been operating for less than six months<br /><br /><b>(3) Node Stability: Node downtime in the last month is less than 10 hours. </b> <br /> Knot stability is an important factor when choosing a knot. But please understand that it is normal for a node to stop for several hours, as it is necessary for the node to be updated and managed.<br /><br /><b>(4) Twitter: Node operator's Twitter account </b> <br /> For the stable operation of the node, it is preferable to be in touch with the administrator. Therefore, we will display nodes that have taken five or more actions, such as tweets, replies, and retweets on Twitter, in the last 5 days.<br /><font color="#ff0000">To prioritize nodes that are active on the social network to promote the Symbol blockchain, so nodes that are active on Twitter will be displayed at the top. </font> In addition, we may impose a penalty in case of excessive promotion of a node or a tweet with the same content.<br /><br />
